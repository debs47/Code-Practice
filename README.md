Python beginnner here!

I am trying to make a simple game with a wizard which collects spell items increasing the score each time.  I have got the wizard to move about but can t get it to collect the items.

I have also added a evil wizard.  I want this to move randomly about the canvas and if it hits the wizard the game ends.

Any help with this would be great!
